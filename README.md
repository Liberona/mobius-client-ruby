# Mobius::Client

Mobius DApp Store API.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mobius-client'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mobius-client

## Developing an application

- DApp Store applications are making payments using Stellar network.
- Every Application holds private key of account receiving money from users.
- Every user holds private key of account containing MOBI specific application can use.
- Permission to use user's money is granted to application via adding it's public key as cosigner to user's account.

### Setting up an application account

Run:

```
mobius-cli create dapp_account
```

This will create application account, MOBI trust line and fund this account with 1000 MOBI on Stellar test network.

Otherwise, you could use https://mobius.network/friendbot

### Setting up test user accounts

You will need:

1. Regular Stellar account not related to Mobius.

```
mobius-cli create account
```

2. DApp Store account not authorized to use your application.

```
mobius-cli create dapp_account
```

3. Authorized DApp Store account.

```
mobius-cli create dapp_account -a <Your application public key>
```

## Authentication

### Principle

Assume we have two parts: user and application. Every part has it's own Stellar key pair. Application issues session token.

Application wants to ensure that:

* User left token intact (to protect from replay attack).
* Token is received and acknowledged by correct user.

The process is simple:

* User requests challenge from the application.
* Challenge is fake transaction, payment of 1 XLM from and to application account. It never goes to ledger.
* Application generates challenge transaction, signs it with own private key and sends it to user.
* User signs received transaction with own private key and sends it back to application along with public key.
* Application ensures that both signatures are valid, time bounds cover current time and grants user access.

Challenge itself is the transaction because only transactions might be signed by Ledger device.

See demo at:

```
cd examples/auth && bundle && ruby auth.rb
```

### Implementing

1. Application side.

```
class AuthController < ActionController::Base
  # GET /auth
  def challenge
    # Generates and returns challenge transaction XDR signed by application to user
    render text: Mobius::Client::Auth::Challenge.call(
      Rails.application.secrets.app.secret_key, # SA2VTRSZPZ5FIC.....I4QD7LBWUUIK
      12.hours                                  # Session duration
    )
  end

  # POST /auth
  def token
    # Validates challenge transaction. It must be:
    #   - Signed by application and requesting user.
    #   - Not older than 10 seconds from now (see Mobius::Client.strict_interval`)
    token = Mobius::Client::Auth::Token.new(
      Rails.application.secrets.app.secret_key, # SA2VTRSZPZ5FIC.....I4QD7LBWUUIK
      params[:xdr]                              # Challenge transaction
      params[:public_key]                       # User's public key
    )

    # Converts issued token into GWT and sends it to user.
    #
    # Note: this is not the requirement. Instead of GWT, application might save token.hash along with time
    # frame and public key to local database and make validations over it.
    render text: Mobius::Client::Auth::GWT.new(
      Rails.application.secret.gwt_secret
    ).to(token)

    rescue Mobius::Client::Error::Unauthorized
      # Signatures are invalid
      render text: "Access denied!"
    rescue Mobius::Client::Error::TokenExpired
      # Current time is outside session time bounds
      render text: "Session expired!"
    rescue Mobius::Client::Error::TokenTooOld
      # Challenge transaction was issued more than 10 seconds ago
      render text: "Challenge tx expired!"
    end
  end
end
```

2. User's side.

Normally, Mobius Wallet will request challenge, validate it and obtain access token. For development purposes you have two options.

* Use `mobius-cli`:

```
mobius-cli auth token http://example.com/auth SA2VTRSZPZ5FIC.....I4QD7LBWUUIK GCWYXW7RXJ5.....SV4AK32ECXFJ
```

where first argument is auth endpoint, second is your user private key and last is your application public key.

* Write own script / rake task:

```
require "mobius-client"
require "net/http"

user_seed = "SA2VTRSZPZ5FIC.....I4QD7LBWUUIK"
app_address = "GCWYXW7RXJ5.....SV4AK32ECXFJ"


```

## Payments



## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
